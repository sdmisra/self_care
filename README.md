### Context:
This project was assigned in Week 3 of Module 1 for Front End students of Turing, Cohort 2211. It was given as a Solo Challenge project to complete alongside leaving to winter break, initially given on Tuesday, December 13th. Work for this project was done between the 13th and the 18th, and submitted the evening of the 18th.

### Learning Goals:
The main learning goals for this project were:
1. Establishing a secure workflow with Git, ensuring no lost work and valuable VCS experience.
2. Develop CSS and HTML skills to build a website to comp, given essentially a blank page alongside initial project spec.
3. Challenge myself to build new functionality within this project, including using an alert, replacing / modifying HTML elements with Javascript in new ways (not just hiding and unhiding elements already given), and learning the basics of CSS flexbox standards.

### Wins + Challenges:
Wins:
1. While challenging, I was able to build the project to comp very closely, and I learned a lot of the vocabulary and syntax of HTML and CSS while doing so.
2. My project feels satisfying to interact with - something I would hope for in general with any websites or web-based apps I create in general.
3. I was able to create this project with almost no outside assistance at all - I purposefully demanded of myself that I find the solutions to all obstacles without relying on others, unless given no other choice. The main exception to this was using my RomCom project (that I completed with Michael Lobato a week prior) as a reference multiple times for syntax and for the randomindex function that we were given at the onset of that project. Given the solitary nature of the workflow here, I was pleased with the final result.


Challenges: 
1. I had a hard time pacing myself on this project, next time I have more solo-paced work I would like to focus more within the first few days on the structure of my project, then spend the rest of the work time developing the interactions and functions within that structure. I found my workflow to be disorganized / confusing until the final days.
2. I still struggle with some of the syntax / methods to access specific pieces of information for my HTML elements. Things like classList, nodeList, etc are still unclear and require further practice and review.
3. I struggled to maintain proper standardization of using classes vs ids to affect my elements via CSS or Javascript. I know the proper way to establish these divisions is to keep classes as reference for CSS, and IDs to reference for Javascript. I will refactor my code a bit to try to fix these problems, but going back to review these standards is far more disruptive to the function of everything than it would have been to simply maintain these standards throughout the project.
